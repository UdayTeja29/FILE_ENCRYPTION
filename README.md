# FILE_ENCRYPTION

This FILE_ENCRYPTION project is used for encrypting and decrypting of files and the encrypted file key is sent thorugh mail.
We need to specify the few things like file path,smtp password,sender mail,receiver mail to encrypt the file.
We also need to set time limit for the file,if the time limit is greater than 0, then the decryption can be done within the time limit.
We can also set the time limit to 0, so that there will be no time limit for the decryption of file.
smtp password is the password which will be there in the mail settings which need to be created by the sender.
And for the decryption we need to select the file path which is encrypted and the key which is sent through mail.
This is all about the FILE_ENCRYPTION project.
